# Prediting COVID with Data Assimilation 

## Brief description of the SIR model from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology)

Compartmental models are a very general modelling technique. They are often applied to the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. The population is assigned to compartments with labels â€“ for example, S, I, or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). People may progress between compartments. 

The SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivatives of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments:

- S: The number of susceptible individuals. When a susceptible and an infectious individual come into "infectious contact", the susceptible individual contracts the disease and transitions to the infectious compartment.
- I: The number of infectious individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and are capable of infecting susceptible individuals.
- R: for the number of removed (and immune) or deceased individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and have either recovered from the disease and entered the removed compartment, or died. It is assumed that the number of deaths is negligible with respect to the total population. This compartment may also be called "recovered" or "resistant".

This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases that are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as measles, mumps, and rubella.

These variables (S, I, and R) represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. To represent that the number of susceptible, infectious, and removed individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of t (time): S(t), I(t), and R(t). For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control.

As implied by the variable function of t, the model is dynamic in that the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time. The importance of this dynamic aspect is most obvious in an endemic disease with a short infectious period, such as measles in the UK prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1968. Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of susceptibles (S(t)) over time. During an epidemic, the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and removed compartments. The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up, e.g. as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.

## The SIR Model as a System of Differential Equations

The SIR model is given by

$`
\begin{align} 
  \begin{split} 
    S\,'&= -kSI\\ 
    I\,'&= kSI-qI\\
    R\,'&= qI
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

subject to $S+I+R=1$, where $S$ represents the proportion of the total population that is susceptible to the disease, $I$ represents the proportion of the total population that is infected, and $R$ represents the proportion of the total population that is recovered from the disease. 

At each time step, the susceptible ($S$) population will decrease as they interact with the infectious ($I$) population by a factor of $k$. Those that are newly infected will move from the susceptible ($S$) population to the infectious ($I$) population. A proportion ($q$) of the infectious ($I$) population will recover from the disease at each time step as well, hence moving from the infectious ($I$) population to the recovered ($R$) population. This simple model assumes that no one infected will die and will all eventually recover. It also assumes that those once recovered from the disease cannot be susceptible with it again. Each population is represented as a percentage of the total, hence $S+I+R=1$.

## Calculus of Variation: Simple Case

In a simpler model shown in [SIR tutorial](SIR_tutorial.ipynb), $k$ and $q$ are assumed to be scalar values. The objective is to choose the model parameters $k$ and $q$, as well as the initial values for each population group, $S_0$, $I_0$, and $R_0$ such that it minimizes the cost functional $`J = \frac{1}{2} {\large\int}_\tau (I - I^{obs})^2 + (R - R^{obs})^2 dt`$ &mdash; the $L^2$-distance between the observation and the model prediction &mdash; using calculus of variation, specifically the adjoint method ($`\tau = \{t: 0 \leq t \leq T\}`$). 

To do this, we first augment the functional with a [Lagrange multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier). Moving the RHS of the SIR model and setting each equation to 0, the problem can be rewritten as $u = 0$, where $`u_1 = S\,' + kSI`$, $`u_2 = I\,' - kSI + qI`$, and $`u_3 = R\,' - qI`$. The augmented cost functional is then the Lagrangian, $J^{*} = J + \langle p, u \rangle$, where the adjoint variable $p$ is a Lagrange multiplier.

The augmented cost functional can then be fully written out as:

$`
\begin{align} 
  \begin{split} 
    J^{*} = &\frac{1}{2} {\large\int}_\tau (I - I^{obs})^2 + (R - R^{obs})^2 dt\\ 
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_S (S\,' + kSI) \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_I (I\,' - kSI + qI) \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_R (R\,' - qI) \,dt
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

We then take the first variation of the augmented functional $J^*$ to obtain:

$`
\begin{align} 
  \begin{split} 
    \delta J^{*} = &{\large\int}_\tau (I - I^{obs})\delta I + (R - R^{obs})\delta R \,dt\\ 
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_S \delta S\,' \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_S \delta (kSI) \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_I \delta I\,' \,dt\\
    &- {\large\int}_\tau p_I \delta (kSI) \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_I \delta (qI) \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau p_R \delta R\,' \,dt\\
    &- {\large\int}_\tau p_R \delta(qI) \,dt
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

Here, we are applying a small perturbation $\alpha$ with respect to the parameters $k$, $q$, $S_0$, $I_0$, and $R_0$, so $\delta u$ can be understood as $`\delta u = \lim\limits_{\alpha \to 0} {\Large\frac{\tilde{u} - u}{\alpha}}`$, where $\tilde{u}$ is the perturbed solution of $u$.

Note that $\delta S + \delta I + \delta R = 0$ and hence $\delta S = - \delta I - \delta R$.

Some of the integrals can be simplified using integration by parts:

$`
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    {\large\int}_\tau p_S \delta S\,' \,dt &= {\large\int}_\tau p_S\!' \delta S \,dt + p_S \delta S \, {\Huge\textbar}_\tau\\
    &= {\large\int}_\tau p_S\!' \delta S \,dt + p_S(T) \delta S_T - p_S(0) \delta S_0\\
    {\large\int}_\tau p_I \delta I\,' \,dt &= {\large\int}_\tau p_I\!' \delta I \,dt + p_I(T) \delta I_T - p_I(0) \delta I_0\\
    {\large\int}_\tau p_R \delta R\,' \,dt &= {\large\int}_\tau p_R\!' \delta R \,dt + p_R(T) \delta R_T - p_R(0) \delta R_0\\
    {\large\int}_\tau (p_S - p_I) \delta (kSI) \,dt &= {\large\int}_\tau (p_S - p_I) k(I\delta S + S \delta I) \,dt + {\large\int}_\tau (p_S - p_I) SI \delta k \,dt\\
    {\large\int}_\tau (p_I - p_R) \delta (qI) \,dt &= {\large\int}_\tau (p_I - p_R)(I \delta q + q \delta I) \,dt
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

Putting them all back together, we have:

$`
\begin{align} 
  \begin{split} 
    \delta J^{*} = &{\large\int}_\tau (I - I^{obs})\delta I + (R - R^{obs})\delta R \,dt\\ 
    &- {\large\int}_\tau p_S\!' \delta S \,dt - {\large\int}_\tau p_I\!' \delta I \,dt - {\large\int}_\tau p_R\!' \delta R \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau (p_S - p_I) k(I\delta S + S \delta I) + (p_S - p_I) SI \delta k \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau (p_I - p_R) q \delta I + (p_I - p_R) I \delta q \,dt\\
    &+ p_S(T) \delta S_T + p_I(T) \delta I_T + p_R (T) \delta R_T\\
    &- p_S(0) \delta S_0 - p_I(0) \delta I_0 - p_R (0) \delta R_0
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

Rearranging the terms gives us:

$`
\begin{align} 
  \begin{split} 
    \delta J^{*} = &{\large\int}_\tau (kI(p_S - p_I) - p_S\!')\delta S \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau (I - I^{obs} + kS(p_S - p_I) + q(p_I - p_R) - p_I\!') \delta I \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau (R - R^{obs} - p_R\!') \delta R \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau SI (p_S - p_I) \delta k \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau I (p_I - p_R) \delta q \,dt\\
    &+ p_S(T) \delta S_T + p_I(T) \delta I_T + p_R (T) \delta R_T\\
    &- p_S(0) \delta S_0 - p_I(0) \delta I_0 - p_R (0) \delta R_0
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

This gives us the following adjoint model:

$`
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    p_S\!' &= kI(p_S - p_I)\\
    p_I\!' &= I - I^{obs} + kS(p_S - p_I) + q(p_I - p_R)\\
    p_R\!' &= R - R^{obs}
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

with the boundary conditions $`p_S(T) = p_I(T) = p_R(T) = 0`$.

When the adjoint model is satisfied, we are left with the following:

$`
\begin{align} 
  \begin{split} 
    \delta J^{*} = &{\large\int}_\tau SI (p_S - p_I) \delta k \,dt\\
    &+ {\large\int}_\tau I (p_I - p_R) \delta q \,dt\\
    &- p_S(0) \delta S_0\\
    &- p_I(0) \delta I_0\\
    &- p_R (0) \delta R_0\\
    \quad\quad = & \nabla_m J \, \delta m
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

where $m$ is the vector containing all of the model parameters. This gives us the desired gradients for each of the input parameters:

$`
\begin{align} 
  \begin{split} 
    \nabla_{S_0} J &= -p_S(0)\\
    \nabla_{I_0} J &= -p_I(0)\\
    \nabla_{R_0} J &= -p_R(0)\\
    \nabla_{k} J &= SI (p_S - p_I)\\
    \nabla_{q} J &= I (p_I - p_R)
  \end{split}
\end{align}
`$

Using these gradient values, the parameters can be found numerically by using gradient descent algorithm.

## [COVID Data Model 1](SIR_COVID1.ipynb)

The objective of this project is to use the Salt Lake County COVID data to see if the final model could predict the holiday spike of COVID cases that occured in the weeks between December of 2021 and January of 2022. 

### Details of the data

The data used for COVID modeling is the summary of new cases per week from the Salt Lake County. This data simply tells us how many new COVID cases occurred during a specified week, between March of 2020 all the way up til September of 2023. For this project, however, only the data up til December 12th of 2021 was used as the training data, and the 5 weeks between December 19th of 2021 to January 19th of 2022 was used as the test data. There was an abnormally high spike in COVID cases during that time as a result of winter holidays, and the task was to see whether it was possible to predict that given the potential spike that happened the year before.
